# AZURE PEAK

## Wiki
The wiki is nonexistent. This is nothing yet. Don't ask about it unless it is about making one.

If you are in absolute need of a wiki source, you can substitute this one: https://azurepeak.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page

Most content has still been unchanged from this.

## Discord
[https://discord.gg/hzJWyGspUC](https://discord.gg/B8zPd2SEx3) - It is required to join the Discord to get verified for entry. Even if you have no intention on communication.

## Ko-fi
[https://www.patreon.com/c/lyndvhar/posts](https://ko-fi.com/lyndvhar ) - Do not contribute your money to me unless you are absolutely certain it will be worth your time, please. This will simply be to help run the server- maybe benefits later.
